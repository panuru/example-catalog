This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) -
full documentation can be found there.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

## Troubleshooting

### `npm test` hangs on macOS Sierra

If you run `npm test` and the console gets stuck after printing `react-scripts test --env=jsdom` to the console there might be a problem with your [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) installation as described in [facebookincubator/create-react-app#713](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/713).

We recommend deleting `node_modules` in your project and running `npm install` (or `yarn` if you use it) first. If it doesn't help, you can try one of the numerous workarounds mentioned in these issues:

* [facebook/jest#1767](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/1767)
* [facebook/watchman#358](https://github.com/facebook/watchman/issues/358)
* [ember-cli/ember-cli#6259](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/issues/6259)

It is reported that installing Watchman 4.7.0 or newer fixes the issue. If you use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), you can run these commands to update it:

```
watchman shutdown-server
brew update
brew reinstall watchman
```

You can find [other installation methods](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html#build-install) on the Watchman documentation page.

If this still doesnâ€™t help, try running `launchctl unload -F ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.facebook.watchman.plist`.

There are also reports that *uninstalling* Watchman fixes the issue. So if nothing else helps, remove it from your system and try again.
